# Password Generator

## Summary

This site serves to generate a unique password for employees based on criteria selecte for by the employee. The password length is specified by the user and can range from 8 to 128 characters. The password can contain up to four character types: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. The types of characters included in the password are also specified by the user. The site is responsive to ensure that the site renders well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
